Package: MicrobiomeBenchmarkData
Title: Datasets for benchmarking in microbiome research
Version: 0.99.0
Description: The MicrobiomeBenchmarkData package provides functionality to 
    access microbiome datasets suitable for benchmarking. These datasets
    have some biological truth, which allows to have expected results for
    comparison. The datasets come from various published sources and
    are provided as TreeSummarizedExperiment objects. Currently, 
    only datasets suitable for benchmarking of differential abundance
    methods are alvailable.
