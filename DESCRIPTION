Package: MicrobiomeBenchmarkData
Title: Datasets for benchmarking methods in microbiome research
Version: 0.99.0
Description: The MicrobiomeBenchmarkData package provides functionality to 
    access microbiome datasets from different sources. The datasets are imported
    in R and delivered as (Tree)SummarizedExperiments. The datasets come from
    previous studies/publications so they contain a known biological truth that
    can be used to know expected results from methods.
