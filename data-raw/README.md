# Scripts to generate the data

This directory contains R scripts for generating the data to upload to
Zenodo and to the data directory (sampleMetadata only).

The scripts must be run in the current directory with setwd or from the
terminal with the `create_datasets.sh` script (commenting and uncommenting
lines as necessary).
